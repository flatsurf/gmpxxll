# gmpxxll

A header only library that adds some long long functions for GMP's C++ interface.

This repository exists so we could share the code between the various projects in the flatsurf project that almost all needed this functionality at some point.

This set of functions is certainly not complete and could likely be improved. Pull Requests are always welcome.
